Ever since you were a kid, 
you've had a special interest in lost cities, and underwater life. 
Atlantis always awed you, and you always wondered 
what kind of secrets the ocean kept. 
So when you opened your eyes and found yourself in 
a bubble at the bottom of the ocean, 
with the ruins of what seemed a lost city, 


you made it your mission to explore and find any secrets it may hold.
